Insomnia supports the ability to import multiple file types. 

Right now, the supported formats are **Insomnia**, **Postman v2**, **HAR**, 
and **Curl**.

## Add Your Own Format

You can contribute your own importer to the open source
[importers project](https://github.com/getinsomnia/importers) on GitHub.
