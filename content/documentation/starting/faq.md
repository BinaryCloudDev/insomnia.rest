## General Questions

**What platforms does Insomnia run on?**<br>
Insomnia has desktop apps for 64-bit versions of Mac, Windows, and Linux. 

**Does Insomnia provide 32-bit binaries?**<br>
At this time, Insomnia is 64-bit only.

**Can I use Insomnia for commercial use?**<br>
Yes, of course!

**How can I support Insomnia?**<br>
First of all, thank you! Since Insomnia is just starting out, the best thing you
can do is help spread the word! You can also submit bug reports, let me know
how you use Insomnia, or sign up for a [paid plan](/pricing).


## Technical Questions

**How can I set an environment variable from a request?**<br>
At this time, that is not possible, but it's coming soon.

**How can I temporarily disable Nunjucks template?**<br>
Sometimes, it is necessary to want to send data that conflicts with the template
engine. You can disable templating by wrapping the desired content in the
[Nunjucks {% raw %} Tag](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#raw).

**Why don't I see anything after importing a backup?**<br>
The import/export feature acts similarly to copying files in a filesystem. If
the import contains data that originated from your application, data will be
overwritten. However, if the import contains data that did not originate from 
your application, new data (including workspaces) may have be created.<br>
 _Hint: You can check for newly created Workspaces in the main (top-left) 
 dropdown._


## Random Questions

**What technologies is Insomnia build with?**<br>
Insomnia is built using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), 
[ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and 
[NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb).

**How can I donate?**<br>
Even though Insomnia has paid plans, a handful of people have emailed about 
donations. You can donate via PayPal on my 
[PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.me/gschier) page.

**How many people work on Insomnia?**<br>
Just [me](http://schier.co/) :)
