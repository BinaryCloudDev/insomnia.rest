_I've gotten a few emails recently asking of ways to contribute to Insomnia, so 
I put together this document to help answer that._

Insomnia is built by me, [Gregory Schier](http://schier.co). Being a
one-person team means that I often don't have time to focus on important things
like promotion, user research, or marketing. Here are few things that you can 
do to help fill those gaps.


## Help Increase the User Base

Currently, Insomnia has less than 1000 daily active users. That is a pretty 
small number so almost anything you do will have an impact. Here are a
few examples.

- write a blog post about Insomnia
- share Insomnia on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+)
- tell your co-workers
- [buy a sticker](https://www.stickermule.com/ca/marketplace/8122-insomnia-rest-client)


## Submit Negative Feedback

Negative feedback is surprisingly hard to get from users. Positive feedback 
provides a great ego boost but, unfortunately, isn't useful most of the time.
So what kind of feedback _is_ useful? If you submit answers questions like
these, that would be great.

- what do you spend the most time doing?
- what frustrates you the most?
- was there anything that wasn't obvious to you?
- if you wouldn't pay $10/month for Insomnia, why?

Please send any and all feedback to 
[support@insomnia.rest](mailto:support@insomnia.rest).


## Show Me How You Use Insomnia

Watching people use Insomnia helps to identify pain points in different 
workflows. Here are a few things you can do to demonstrate your use cases.

- submit a short (or long) screencast
- write an email explaining your use cases
- tell me what features you use the most
