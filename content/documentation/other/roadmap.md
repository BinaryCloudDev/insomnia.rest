In an effort to help cut down on feature request emails, here's a list some of
the major things that are planned for completion over the next few months. 

- Request chaining 
- Multiple active environments
- Plugin/scripting system

This list may change at any time. If there's missing that you would like to 
see, or something here that you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out!
