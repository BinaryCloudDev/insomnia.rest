the major things that are planned for completion over the next few months. 

- Request chaining 
- OAuth support
- Windows authentication support (NTLM)
- Multiple active environments
- More authentication types (OAuth)
- View raw request/response communication
- Preview environment variables inline
- Plugin/scripting system

This list may change at any time. If there's missing that you would like to 
see, or something here that you would like to discuss, feel free to reach out!
