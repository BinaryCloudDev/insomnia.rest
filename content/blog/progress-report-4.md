[Last Month's Recap](/blog/progress-report-3) was fairly uneventful due to the huge drop in
usage caused by the holiday season. Thankfully, usage is back up this month and things are
looking great! Insomnia crossed last month's failed goal of $100 MRR and also surpassed 3,000
daily active users.

A lot of stuff happened in January, so this post is a bit longer than normal. 

## Overview Metrics

Inspired by Courtland's [Monthly Review](https://www.indiehackers.com/blog/month-in-review-2016-12) 
on the Indie Hackers blog, I decided to include more metrics this time. So, I put together a couple.

To start off, here's an overview of some of this month's key metrics.

| Metric                    | Value This Month | Change        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Active App Users          | 16,131           | +27%          |
| New App Users             | 7,539            | +40%          |
| Monthly Recurring Revenue | $110             | +140%         |
| Recognized Revenue        | $390             | +25%          |
| New Trial Customers       | 146              | +200%         |
| New Paying Customers      | 11               | +57%          |
| Trial Conversion Rate     | 8%               | -2% &#x1f44e; | 

## App Usage 

App usage picked up a lot since the holiday season ended. This month's arbitrary notable 
milestone was **crossing 3,000 daily active users**. That's a big number,
right? Alright, enough jokes. Let's take a look at the daily active users graph.

You'll notice that Insomnia recovered nicely from the huge decrease in December usage. Insomnia
is now well over 3000 daily active users, and it's growing quickly. The cause of this growth
is partly due to being featured on the [Electron landing page](http://electron.atom.io/), but 
it is mostly general growth. All traffic sources seem to be growing consistently 
(social, search, word of mouth, referrals).

## Revenue

In the previous recaps I've shared MRR numbers, but neglected to mention actual _recognized
revenue_ (the money that hits the bank account). In most subscription models, these numbers 
are fairly similar, but due to Insomnia's option to bill up-from annually (instead of monthly),
recognized revenue is much higher. Because of this, I'll start covering both numbers in this
and future recaps.

Insomnia **earned $390 in January**, which is $280 more than the stated MRR. This is 
because 45% of customers subscribed to annual billing (instead of monthly), meaning they pay
up-front for the entire year, at a 16% discount. 

If this high proportion of annual subscribers continues, it will greatly decrease the time it
takes to become sustainable. So, if you're thinking of subscribing, save the 16% and help 
kick-start Insomnia to sustainability. &#x1f60a;

Alright, enough talk about _actual_ revenue. Let's continue the monthly tradition of examining
MRR growth. Here's an impressive hockey-stick-shaped chart showing MRR over the past few months.

![Insomnia Monthly Recurring Revenue December 2016](/images/blog/mrr-7.png)

MRR is now up to $110, which is **140% growth over last month**. While this number _is_ amazing, 
it much higher than it should be. Assuming the target market does not change and the proportion
of users who upgrade remains constant, then MRR growth should match the growth rate of the user
base, which has been between 20-30% per month. So how does this affect the path to sustainability?

### Minimum Revenue Growth

My MRR goal for Insomnia is $5000. Hitting this number would mean that I can sustain my current
lifestyle, though that is still only about 60% of what I could make by getting a real job. In
December's recap, I mentioned I would need to grow MRR by 50% for 12 months to reach that, but 
that didn't take into account the extra runway that incoming revenue provides. So I wrote a small
script to calculate some more accurate numbers.

Basically **the lowest growth rate Insomnia can have to eventually be profitable is 25%**. This
would make the first derivative of my bank account positive 

From observation, it seems like the abnormally high MRR growth rate might continue, but I 
don't want to count on it. Assuming that MRR grows at the same rate as user growth does, 
**Insomnia will reach the $5000 goal in 14 months**. That's not good because my runway is only
10 months. However, As more revenue comes in, my runway stretches out.

After some calculations, the lowest growth rate that will let me surpass my runway is 25%. This
assumes that I have $19,000 in the bank and have a burn of $2000 / month.

| Starting MRR | Min Growth |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| $110         | 25%        |
| $200         | 20%        |
| $500         | 10%        |

The previous graph shows that initial MRR makes a huge difference, meaning that it's really 
important to push hard right away to increase conversion rates and grow the user base.
