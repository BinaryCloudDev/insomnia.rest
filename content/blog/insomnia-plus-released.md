title: Introducing Insomnia Plus

Today, I'm proud to introduce Insomnia Plus â€“ a paid add-on to Insomnia that 
lets you seamlessly sync Insomnia data across all multiple devices. Along with
this, Plus also provides a consistent, secure, and up-to-date backup of all 
your work.

With Plus, simply sign into your account and your data will be there. It 
just works. However, there is a lot that you wont't see. Security and and 
privacy being the biggest.

## Secure By Default

Insomnia, by nature, is often used to communicate with secure and
private APIs. HTTP requests can contain sensitive information like API keys,
usernames, and passwords. For this reason,  Insomnia treats security as a
priority, implementing many of the same techniques as industry-standard password 
managers like [1Password](https://1password.com/), 
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), and 
[DashLane](https://www.dashlane.com/). 

The password you chose when signing up for Insomnia used in both the
authentication and encryption/decryption process (so don't lose it!). However,
it is not used directly. In fact, your password is never sent to the server.

_Check out the [Security Overview](/documentation/security) to find more
details on how this works._

While this was a major effort to get done, it is just the beginning. There is
now a secure, reliable, and extensible platform to build more advanced features
on top of.

If you want to see something that wasn't talked about I'd love to chat about it.
