I've been working hard on the more technical parts of the app recently, so I decided 
to take a short break and try something more creative. So, I spent the past few days 
creating additional color themes. To start, there are **nine themes** to choose from â€“
three _basic_, and six _premium_.

Premium themes are available to all [Insomnia Plus](/pricing/) users.

I hope you enjoy these new colors! I had a lot of fun making theme, so expect to see more
become available in the future.
