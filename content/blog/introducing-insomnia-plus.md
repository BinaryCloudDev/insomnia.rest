Today, I'm proud to introduce Insomnia Plus â€“ the first paid addition to Insomnia 
that syncs data seamlessly across all of your devices. Plus also acts as 
a secure backup, so you can _rest_ assured that you will never accidentally 
lose you work!

With Plus, simply sign into your account and your data will be there. It 
just works. However, there a lot happening behind the scenes, such as 
**end-to-end data encryption**, **smart conflict resolution**, and robust **offline
support**.

## Always Backed up and in Sync

We all know how important it is to keep frequent backups of data. Hard drive failures 
and crashes happen all the time. Now, you have one less thing to worry about.

Once signed in to Plus, data is automatically backed up whenever changes are made 
And, if you are signed in to multiple devices, changes will appear
across all of them within seconds.


## Secure and Private by Default

Insomnia, by nature, is often used to communicate with secure and
private Services. HTTP requests may contain sensitive information like API keys,
usernames, or passwords. For this reason, Insomnia Plus treats security as a high
priority, implementing many of the same techniques used by industry-leading 
password management apps like [1Password](https://1password.com/), 
[LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), and 
[DashLane](https://www.dashlane.com/).

## Final Words

Building the initial iteration of sync was a major effort, but it was just the first 
step. Now, with a stable and secure foundation to build on, expect to see more advanced 
features like **team collaboration** and **versioning** in the near future.

If you decide to sign up for Plus, I'd like to say a huge _THANK YOU_ for helping 
support my continuous effort of making Insomnia awesome! Also, be sure to let me know
what you think, so I can ensure the product heads in the right direction.

Thanks!
