Four months ago
[I left my previous job](https://schier.co/blog/2016/08/05/forging-a-new-path/)
to work full-time on Insomnia. Since then, I've had over 300 amazing 
conversations with users have helped identify bugs, given feedback, and 
suggested new features. Insomnia now has over 2000 daily active users across 
the Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms.

These conversations have not only helped improve stability and usability of the 
app, but have also helped validate and shape the first features of Insomnia 
Plus â€“ a premium add-on for Insomnia that enables powerful features like
**data sync** and **collaboration**. 


## Data Sync

Data sync provides the ability to securely sync Insomnia data across multiple 
machines, which also acts as an up-to-date backup of all your data (in case 
something terrible happens). 

While Insomnia is running, the app will actively sync data to and from the 
server whenever changes occur. On top of this, sync is 
**end-to-end encrypted**, meaning that all data is first encrypted in the 
app before sending it to the server. 

Data is encrypted with a key that is derived from your account password (which 
is not stored on the server), meaning that Insomnia (or any other third party) 
cannot read or access your data. This is crucial for Insomnia users, because 
Insomnia data can contain important API keys, usernames, and passwords.


## Team Collaboration

_NOTE: Team collaboration is not yet available in the beta but is coming 
soon..._

Automated sync can be useful for individual users, but the same workflow doesn't
translate to teams very well.

Imagine working in a code editor where every line of code typed typed was 
immediately synced to all of your coworkers computers. It would be chaos! 
Because of this, Insomnia takes a different approach for teams, providing a 
a manual push/pull model similar to a software development team using Git.


## Join the Beta!

If you would like to help test Insomnia Plus, head over to the 
[Getting Started Documentation](/documentation/plus) for steps on how to enable 
it.

As always, please send all feedback my way.
