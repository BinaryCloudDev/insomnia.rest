December is a notoriously slow month because of the holidays. I decided to take some
time off to reflect on things and spend time with family, so this recap will be 
relatively short. _(Still interesting, I promise!)_

## Daily Active Users

Since Insomnia is mostly used in the workplace, holiday vacation time made a 
large dent on usage numbers this month. The daily active users chart below shows 
clear growth at the start of the month but drops off significantly towards the end.

## Monthly Recurring Revenue

Much like usage, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) also seemed to be affected 
by the holiday season (although it's hard to tell with such small numbers). 
In December, **MRR increased by over 100%**, ending the month at $50 MRR. The
following chart shows MRR over the last five months.

To put this into perspective, **$50 MRR is 1% of a moderate salary** in my city. 
The finish line is in sight, but still very far away.

In order to reach the magic $5000/mo mark before my savings run dry, I will 
need to grow MRR by 50% per month for the next twelve months. This seems like an
achievable goal and the launch of teams next month should help get there. 

## This Month's Wins and Losses

This month, I wanted to force myself to think back on more specific things that happened, 
so this section is a new attempt at doing that. It's not very organized, but here's a 
list of noteworthy things that happened this month.

- **WIN:** Got Insomnia featured on the [Electron home page](http://electron.atom.io/)
- **WIN:** Someone donated $100!
- **WIN:** Had a blog post [do well on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5hf898/wrote_about_why_i_think_electron_is_a_web/)
- **WIN:** Finished and deployed the [web interface](/app/) to manage Insomnia accounts
- **WIN:** Was able to delete custom (buggy) DNS resolution code after figuring out how to do 
it with the HTTP framework Insomnia already used
- **LOSS:** Didn't finish Teams on time
- **LOSS:** Didn't hit any set goals

## Next Month Goals

Last month I set three goals for myself and failed to meet all of them. I failed
to **launch Teams and reach $100 MRR**, didn't **publish content once a week**, and 
didn't **start reacting to more actionable metrics**. I _did_ make a
sizable dent in all of these but more important things distracted me from completing
them, leaving me to believe that the goals set could have been better chosen.

This month I chose only important and achievable goals. Here's what I plan to 
accomplish in January.

**Get first paying team:**<br>
Teams wasn't completed in December, but most of the work is now
done. I've set a hard launch date of **Wednesday January 11th**, which should leave enough
time to get the first team on board (even if it requires cold emails and hand-holding).

**Finish [console.rest](https://console.rest/) integration:**<br>
[Console.rest](https://console.rest/) is an open source project started by the folks at
[Paw](https://paw.cloud/). I have most of the integration work completed, so wrapping it
up should take a few days at most.

## Wrap Up

Well, that's it for 2016! It's been almost exactly six months since I quit my job to 
take on Insomnia full-time. I'm super excited to have passed the $1 MRR milestone and
can't wait to see what happens in 2017.
