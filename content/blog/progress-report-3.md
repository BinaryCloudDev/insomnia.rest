December is a notoriously slow month because of the holidays. I decided to take some
time off to reflect on things and spend time with family, so this recap will be 
relatively short. _(Still interesting though, I promise!)_

## Daily Active Users

Since Insomnia is mostly used in the workplace, holiday vacation time has made a 
great impact on usage numbers this month. The chart below shows clear growth at
the start of the month, but drops off significantly towards the end. These numbers
should be back up to normal by mid-January.

## Monthly Recurring Revenue

Much like usage, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) also seemed to be affected 
by the holiday season, although it's hard to tell with such small numbers. 
In December **MRR increased by over 100%**, ending the month at $50 MRR. Such
high increases are likely to become less frequent over time, but one can always
hope!

To put this into perspective, $50 MRR is 1% of what I need to earn to live a moderate
life in my city (around $5000/mo). If I can hit this number, I won't have a luxurious
life by any means, but it will be enough to comfortably pay the bills. The finish 
line is in sight, but still very far away.

In order to reach this magic number of $5000/mo before my savings run dry, I will 
need to grow MRR by around 50% every month for the next twelve months. This seems 
like an achievable goal, and I hope that the launch of teams will help me get there.
I expected to launch teams last month, but there were a few fires that came up that 
delayed completion. However, at this point Teams is 95% complete, so I'm confident 
it will be out the door by mid-January.

## This Month's Wins and Losses

This section is something new for this month's recap. I wanted to force myself to think back
on more specific things that happened, so this is an attempt to force myself to do that. It's
not very organized, but here's a list of noteworthy things that happened this month.

- **WIN:** Got Insomnia featured on the [Electron home page](http://electron.atom.io/)
- **WIN:** Someone donated $100!
- **WIN:** Had a blog post [do well on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5hf898/wrote_about_why_i_think_electron_is_a_web/)
- **WIN:** Finished the [web interface](/app/) to manage Insomnia accounts
- **WIN:** Was able to delete custom (buggy) DNS resolution code after figuring out how to do 
it with the HTTP framework Insomnia already used
- **LOSS:** Didn't finish Teams on time
- **LOSS:** Didn't hit any set goals

## Next Month Goals

Last month I set three goals for myself and failed to meet all of them. I failed
to **launch Teams and reach $100 MRR**, didn't **publish content once a week**, and 
didn't **start reacting to more actionable metrics**. I actually _did_ make a
sizable dent in all of these, but I feel that my failure to meet them was not due to
failure to execute, but rather to picking goals that were not specific or important
enough to actually devote time to doing.

This month I chose only important and achievable goals. Here's what I plan to accomplish in January.

**Get first paying team:**<br>
As mentioned above, Teams wasn't completed in December, but most of the work is now
done. I've set a hard launch date of **Wednesday January 11th**, which should leave enough
time to get the first team on board (even if it requires cold emails and hand-holding).

**Finish [console.rest](https://console.rest/) integration:**<br>
[Console.rest](https://console.rest/) is an open source project started by the folks at
[Paw](https://paw.cloud/). It's purpose is to make API formats more easily transferable
between tools. For example, it could be used to convert a Postman export to Insomnia 
format.

## Wrap Up

Well, that's it for 2016! It's been almost exactly six months since I quit my job to 
take on Insomnia full-time. I'm super excited to have passed the $1 MRR milestone, and
can't wait to see what 2017 has in store.
